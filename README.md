# Augmenting captions for dense image cationing via ChatGPT

This repository contains the implementation of the Augmented Paraphrasing Resampling Module (APRM), an integral part of the broader Augmented Dense Captioning Architecture (EADCA). The APRM module utilizes the ChatGPT model during the training stage to enhance the diversity of dense captioning results. Incorporate this module into your existing dense captioning implementation.

### Abstract

Dense captioning is capable of producing rich descriptions of Region of Interests (RoIs) in intricate visual scenes. Despite many encouraging outcomes achieved, an outstanding challenge still endures. The low vocabulary learning efficiency due to the imbalanced learning mechanism largely hinders the diversity of the dense captioning results. To mitigate this issue, in this work, we introduce an Augmented dense captioning architecture (EADCA). It incorporates a novel augmented paraphrasing re-sampling module (APRM) via the trendy ChatGPT model at the training stage to increase the diversity of the dense captioning results. The presented method has been evaluated on the publicly available dense captioning dataset and noticeably outperforms other existing approaches with regard to the evaluation measure mean Average Precision (mAP).
